# 注意事项,,,,,,
#    1. var_name为stda要素名
#    2. var_units为当前数据的在cassandra中的单位，单位名参考metpy.units（即pint库），未知或者不确定不填写空着即可，可带倍数
#    3. cassandra_discription为描述信息，目前不进行任何使用，可看作为配置行的说明
#    4. cassandra_level高空请填写any代表任意层，地面或者特殊单层请填写具体某一层，未知或者不确定请填写any
#    5. 以data_name,var_name,level_type列作为查询列，保证能确定唯一一行
