    1 参数的选择对于最后的结果非常重要, 最好将典型的气旋显示出来,
      主观测量要识别气旋的大小, 获得参数的值.
    2 search_rad_min和slp_diff_test的设置经验上更为重要一些.
    3 典型气旋中心常有多个低极值点, 因此search_rad_min设置太小会造成
      同一个气旋多个气旋被识别出来, search_rad_min最好能够覆盖
      气旋的中心部位.
    4 slp_diff_test要根据search_rad_min的距离来设置, 不能设置太大,
      会造成很难满足条件而无法识别出气旋, 也不能设置太小而把太多的
      弱气旋包含进来, 一般考虑0.25/100km.
    5 search_rad_max最好包含气旋的最外围, 但其主要作用是保证有4以上的点
      高于中心气压, 这个一般很好满足, 因此不太重要.
    6 search_rad_ndiv就用默认的3就行, 一般第一个圆环就能满足条件.

                           to use for each location.  Default is 400e3 meters.
                           This value is also used to test for multiple lows
                           (see commenting below).
    :param search_rad_ndiv: Integer number of shells between Search_Rad_Min and
                            Search_Rad_Max to search.  Scalar.  Default is 3.
    :param slp_diff_test: A low pressure center is identified if it is entirely
                          surrounded by grid points in the region between
                          Search_Rad_Min and Search_Rad_Max that are all higher

                          of slp_diff_test to use for each location.
                          Default is 2 hPa.
